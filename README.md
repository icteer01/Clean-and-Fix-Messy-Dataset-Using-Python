This project involves teaching a computer to correct a simple dataset. The dataset consists of variables classified as common elements found in an employee database. Names are formatted to be grammaticaly correct alongside the removal of whitespace, and absent age values are subtituted with the median age of the dataset. The countries are formatted in a uniform manner across each variable where any absent countries are converted to 'Unknown'. Lastly, the salaries are set as a float-point datatype with thousands separators while the dataset is sorted in alphabetical order by name and wiped of duplicates.
